# HR-Analytics-Using-Power-BI
## Project Overview
The "Diversity and Inclusion Analysis" project aims to assess workplace diversity and inclusion metrics, enabling organizations to understand the current state of hiring, promotions, turnover rates, performance ratings, and executive gender balance. By utilizing interactive Power BI dashboards, this project provides actionable insights to foster a more inclusive workplace and identify areas for improvement.
## Problem Statement
Organizations often struggle to quantify and monitor diversity and inclusion metrics effectively. Without clear, data-driven insights, it is challenging to identify gaps in gender balance, disparities in promotions, or turnover trends. This project addresses the need for comprehensive visualization and analysis of key diversity metrics to drive informed decision-making.
