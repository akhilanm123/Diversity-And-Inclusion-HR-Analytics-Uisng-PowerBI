# HR-Analytics-Using-Power-BI
## Project Overview
The "Diversity and Inclusion Analysis" project aims to assess workplace diversity and inclusion metrics, enabling organizations to understand the current state of hiring, promotions, turnover rates, performance ratings, and executive gender balance. By utilizing interactive Power BI dashboards, this project provides actionable insights to foster a more inclusive workplace and identify areas for improvement.
